#### Grid controller feature 

__2025.05.06__

The point of this feature is to create a basic astar grid navigation logic. Make it register props on the ground as items or covers.

As a player...
- [x] I want to be able to hover over grids and check if it's an available space or not ( is there something on it or not )
- [x] I want to be able to know what is on an occupied grid and get some basic infos about it.

~~- [ ] I want to be able to navigate around the grid with the arrow keys and with the mouse.~~
