# Story elements

A mysterious strain of bacteria begins breaking down oil at the molecular level, rendering all global petroleum reserves—crude and refined—useless. The collapse is fast and total: transportation halts, supply chains break, synthetic materials degrade, and society plunges into chaos.

The world, once built on oil-powered retrofuturism, must adapt or die.

Key Story Seeds
Is the bacteria natural evolution, or was it engineered (bioweapon, eco-terrorism, corporate sabotage)?

Was it an accident, or intentional? If so, by whom—and why?

Are there survivors with access to clean energy? What factions rise from the collapse?

How does a retro-tech world cope without oil—can analog tech fill the gap?
