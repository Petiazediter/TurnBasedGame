# Untitled game

The game is a 2D turn-based combat game where there are no random hit-chances. The basic combat is ranged combat with defenses. There are only full defense , no half defense. Instead there might be destructible ones, that have weaknesses.

# Story elements

A mysterious strain of bacteria begins breaking down oil at the molecular level, rendering all global petroleum reserves—crude and refined—useless. The collapse is fast and total: transportation halts, supply chains break, synthetic materials degrade, and society plunges into chaos.

The world, once built on oil-powered retrofuturism, must adapt or die.

Key Story Seeds
Is the bacteria natural evolution, or was it engineered (bioweapon, eco-terrorism, corporate sabotage)?

Was it an accident, or intentional? If so, by whom—and why?

Are there survivors with access to clean energy? What factions rise from the collapse?

How does a retro-tech world cope without oil—can analog tech fill the gap?

Tone & Themes
Retrofuturistic decay (e.g., Blade Runner meets Children of Men)

Ecological mystery and collapse

Resource scarcity and adaptation

Power vacuums: corporations, cults, rogue states, and scavengers


Basic GDD:

**Project DUNA - Game Design Document (GDD) - v0.1**

---

### **Game Title:**

Project DUNA

### **Genre:**

Isometric Tactical Turn-Based Survival

### **Platform:**

PC (initial), potential for later release on console

### **Visual Style:**

2D pixel art with a retrofuturistic and post-industrial atmosphere (inspired by *Stirring Abyss* and *Bladerunner*)

### **Core Concept:**

In a near-future Earth ravaged by a mysterious oil-eating airborne bacteria, humanity’s fossil-fuel infrastructure collapses. Entire regions become uninhabitable due to bacterial contamination. Megacorporations suppress the news and deploy elite teams to investigate and contain the spread. The player leads one such team — the latest rescue unit sent to uncover the fate of a missing research squad deep within the wilderness of Hungary.

### **Setting:**

Post-collapse Europe. Hungary's Danube-adjacent countryside becomes a rich, eerie wilderness filled with overgrown ruins, forgotten infrastructure, and contaminated zones. Nature is resurging — but mutated.

### **Story Premise:**

The player controls a newly formed corporate expedition team. Their goal: locate a lost research squad and recover data. Along the way, they uncover research logs, clues, and evidence pointing to a silent ecological war. Towns are gone, survivors are few, and wildlife is alien. Most people in corporate havens don’t even believe animals still exist.

### **Key Features:**

#### 1. **Tactical Turn-Based Combat (No RNG):**

* Positioning and planning are crucial.
* Hits are guaranteed; player decisions determine outcomes.
* Unique parry mini-game system allows skilled players to reduce or counter incoming damage during enemy turns.

#### 2. **Squad-Based Progression:**

* Recruit and control a small squad (initially starting with 1 member, quickly expanding).
* Classless system with flexible roles built around gear and experience upgrades.

#### 3. **Camp System (Between Missions):**

* Players return to makeshift camps between levels.
* Manage resources, treat injuries, upgrade gear, and interact with surviving crew.

#### 4. **Exploration & Scavenging:**

* Levels are handcrafted but limited in scope.
* Players explore contaminated zones, locate research logs, scavenge materials, and encounter mutated animals.

---

### **Combat Mechanics:**

* Grid-based movement.
* No hit chance or evasion — everything is deterministic.
* Parry System:

  * Skill-based timing mini-game triggered during enemy attacks.
  * Perfect parry = full block and possible counterattack.
  * Partial parry = reduced damage.
  * Failure = full damage, potential status effects.

---

### **Demo Scope:**

#### **Level 1: "Entry Point"**

* Tutorial mission.
* Start alone, discover second team member.
* Introduce basic movement, interaction, parry mechanic, and environmental hazards.
* Encounter first contaminated animal (e.g., mutated boar or bird).
* Ends with finding a wrecked supply drone and the first research log.

---

### **Target Audience:**

Fans of slow-paced, atmospheric strategy games (e.g., *XCOM*, *Stirring Abyss*, *Darkest Dungeon*) looking for deterministic combat with rich world-building.

---

### **Next Steps:**

* Prototype combat and movement systems.
* Build art assets for tileset, characters, and UI.
* Implement parry mini-game and animation feedback.
* Create one playable level with camp scene.
